- Had to set mtu to 1400 on eth3 (internal_api) compute-1 to get discover_hosts to pass
- make sure to ip link set dev up on all interfaces on the nodes, otherwise
  nics are not detected as "active" by os-net-config
- create disk.img and /dev/loop0 on compute nodes
  on reboot: partx -av disk.img
   (can't use kpartx)
