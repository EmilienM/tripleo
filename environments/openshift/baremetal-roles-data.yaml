# Specifies which roles (groups of nodes) will be deployed
# Note this is used as an input to the various *.j2.yaml
# jinja2 templates, so that they are converted into *.yaml
# during the plan creation (via a mistral action/workflow).
#
# The format is a list, with the following format:
#
# * name: (string) mandatory, name of the role, must be unique
# * name_mapping: (string) optional. A name mapping for the role. Can be used to
#     produce mappings that correspond to other existing roles during
#     the jinja2 templating process. Defaults to name if not specified.
#
# CountDefault: (number) optional, default number of nodes, defaults to 0
# sets the default for the {{role.name}}Count parameter in overcloud.yaml
#
# HostnameFormatDefault: (string) optional default format string for hostname
# defaults to '%stackname%-{{role.name.lower()}}-%index%'
# sets the default for {{role.name}}HostnameFormat parameter in overcloud.yaml
#
# disable_constraints: (boolean) optional, whether to disable Nova and Glance
# constraints for each role specified in the templates.
#
# disable_upgrade_deployment: (boolean) optional, whether to run the
# ansible upgrade steps for all services that are deployed on the role. If set
# to True, the operator will drive the upgrade for this role's nodes.
#
# upgrade_batch_size: (number): batch size for upgrades where tasks are
# specified by services to run in batches vs all nodes at once.
# This defaults to 1, but larger batches may be specified here.
#
# ServicesDefault: (list) optional default list of services to be deployed
# on the role, defaults to an empty list. Sets the default for the
# {{role.name}}Services parameter in overcloud.yaml
#
# tags: (list) list of tags used by other parts of the deployment process to
# find the role for a specific type of functionality. Currently a role
# with both 'primary' and 'controller' is used as the primary role for the
# deployment process. If no roles have have 'primary' and 'controller', the
# first role in this file is used as the primary role.
